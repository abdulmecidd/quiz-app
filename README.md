# quiz-app
A Quiz Application made with Javascript, HTML as well as Bootstrap

This application uses the constructor structure of javascript. Thanks to the constructor structure, the showQuestions function gives the reference of the question. In this way, the functions of the programme reference the object with this keyword. In this way, less memory usage is provided with reference objects. After the "Start Quiz" button is clicked, the showQuestion function runs and fetches the reference of the questions from the referenced object. If the user gets the correct answer, he/she earns points and the points are shown at the end of the application.
