# Quiz Application

A Quiz application built with Javascript, HTML, and Bootstrap. 
## Introduction

The application utilizes the constructor structure of Javascript. With the constructor structure, the showQuestions function references the question, enabling the program functions to reference the object using the "this" keyword. This approach results in less memory usage with reference objects. When the "Start Quiz" button is clicked, the showQuestion function runs and fetches the referenced questions object. Users earn points for correct answers, and the total points are displayed at the end of the application.
